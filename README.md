# Cryptocurrenicies
This project involved an analysis for clients who were interested in getting into cryptocurrencies.  It is an unsupervised machine learning project in which data is processed and clustered using an algorithm to fit machine learning requirements,  and principal components are reduced using PCA. The data is then represented by the means of a scatter plot and a 3D Scatter.
